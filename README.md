# Interviewing Vault

Dear interviewer, welcome to my interviewing vault. This repository contains a
collection of projects, libraries, and organizations and what have you that I
have contributed to during my career.

I hope you find this information useful to understand my work and my
contributions to the communities. Analyzing this information will give you a
better understanding of my skills and the technologies I have worked with.

This is not an exhaustive list of everything I have done, since they are a
least millions of closed-source codes that I am not able to share. As well as
many other discussions, code reviews, and other contributions that are not
tracked in this repository.
